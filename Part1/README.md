# SystemVerilog_Constraints-Part1

1. Range Constraint -  Constraint for a 4-bit random number such that the number is between 5 and 10.
2. Value Set Constraints - Constraint for an 8-bit opcode such that it can only take the values 0x10, 0x20, or 0x30.
3. Relational Constraints - Constraint for two random 8-bit numbers such that a is always greater than b.
4. Pattern Generation - Constraint for generating 1010101010 pattern.
5. Pattern Generation - Constraint for generating 00110011001100110011 pattern.
6. Write a constraint to generate a number such that number is always a multiple of 4 and is less than 20 . This means that possible values for rand number can be         0,4,8,12,or 16
7. Write a constraint to generate a pattern 5,4,3,2,1 (Reverse Count Pattern)
8. Write a constraint to fill an array with the first 5 square numbers :1,4,9,16,25.
9. Write a constraint to randomize an array of size 10 such that the number must be a power of 2, and the randomized numbers in the array must be greater than 8 or       equal to 8.
10. Write a constraint to generate 8-bit random number such that number is divisible by 3, Additionally ensure that the 8-bit number must have an even number of 1's.
