# SystemVerilog_Constraints-Part2

1. Write a constraint to generate a random 5-bit number that is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 6.Ensure the number falls within the range 0 to 31.
2. Write a constraint that generate a random number 'a' between 1 to 50, the number must not be divisible by 2,3,and 5.
3. Write a constraint to generate an array such that the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half.
4. Write a constraint such that in an array of size is 10, and the difference between every two adjacent elements is 3.
5. Write a constraint to generate an array of size 6, and each element should be in between 10 and 20, and the sum of the elements must be 100.
6. Write a constraint to generate a variable that is divisible by 6 and 9 but not by 18.
7. Write a constraint to generate a sequence alternating between a positive even number and a negative odd number.
8. Write a constraint such that in a queue of size 10, the median value is always 50.
9. Write a constraint such that the binary representation of a number is palindromic.
10. Write a constraint to generate a pattern [1,0] alternatively and array of size is 12.
